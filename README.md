# Introduction



Mutation Mining allows the interactive exploration of variant detection results on the Cloud. Our platform can handle millions of genomic variants with an easy-to use interface.

Main features are:

* Auto-analytic interface of genomic variants on the Web.
* Interactive filtering of detected variants based on genotype, coverage, population frequency, impact, etc.
* Visualization of aligned files and variants with Integrative Genome Viewer.
* Linked with the main SNPs and gene repositories.
