For this guide we have used the project PRJEB41088\_AngelmanTrio (link), each user will have an associated project that may be different from others, but the structure is the same for all of them

| Methods           | Project description and versions used in its creation |

#### In this section there are four possibilities

* [Display variants for all samples](page-1.md)

* Open [report](display-variants-for-samples/mutations.md), [prediction of populations](display-variants-for-samples/populations.md) and variants [table by samples](display-variants-for-samples/)

* [Display projects with user-saved filters](filtered-variants.md)
